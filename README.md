# Flutter JWT Auth

This project showcases a simple implementation of JWT auth in Flutter.

A detailed explanation of the implementation can be
found [in this blog](https://bettercoding.dev/flutter-jwt-authentication/) post
on [bettercoding.dev](https://bettercoding.dev).

## Server

This project provides a simple test server that implements basic JWT auth endpoints.
See https://github.com/bettercoding-dev/shelf-jwt-test-server for more details.

To start the server in this project, simple run:

```shell
dart server/shelf-jwt-test-server/bin/server.dart
```

## Follow-Along

If you want to implement certain parts of the project yourself to improve your coding skills, you can
check out the `follow-along` branch.

```shell
git checkout follow-along
```

In this branch, I removed certain parts of the implementation, and you can code it yourself with the help of the
tutorial.
